# ♞ Knight's tour

This program returns a path for a knight's tour on a nxn chessboard, where n <= 100. The output consists of a list of coordinates indicating the successive knight's jumps on the chessboard.  
For n < 30 a graphical representation is included.


## ♘ Usage

To run the program, pass the input size n and the starting point as arguments.  
For example:

```
python3 dfstour.py 16 [1,2]
```
